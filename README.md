EZsciplot_GUI is a versatile and user-friendly scientific plotting interface built with PySide6, designed to streamline the visualization and export of research data, particularly in disciplines that require customized plotting workflows.

ðŸŒŸ Key Features
Custom Plotting Made Shareable
Many scientific fields adopt specific plotting formats or data filtering criteria tailored to their research needs. This tool allows such customized plotting styles to be easily reused and shared within research groups or across the field â€” even by team members without programming experience.

Hierarchical Data Structure Support
The interface organizes data from specimen to site (or sample), aligning with the typical data hierarchy used in scientific studies, especially in the Earth and environmental sciences.

Flexible Styling and Export
Easily adjust color schemes, layout elements, and export high-quality figures for publication or presentations with minimal effort.
